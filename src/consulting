<h1>Hiring Libav developers</h1>

<p>
If you're running a business that uses Libav or would like to use Libav,
you will sometimes want to have an expert, i.e. one of the original
developers, work with you to figure out an issue, fix a bug or add
some new feature.
</p>

<p>
This page is a list of those Libav developers that are available for
employment or consulting. The Libav project highly recommends these people
to be hired by your business. By hiring one of these developers, your
business can also (indirectly) support the development of Libav.
