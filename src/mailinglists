<h2>FFmpeg Mailing Lists</h2>

<?php require ('navbar.html'); ?>

<p>
Please follow the netiquette when posting on FFmpeg mailing lists, especially
avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">top-posting</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_hijacking">thread hijacking</a>.
Trespass these rules at the risk of being flamed.

<p>
<b>Need help with FFmpeg?</b> First, this very important question:

<center><h3>Are you using the latest SVN version of FFmpeg?</h3></center>

Seriously, FFmpeg is in a state of perpetual development and "official"
releases are highly infrequent and largely a formality. The releases do
not reflect the state of the FFmpeg's current technology. You should be using
the latest SVN checkout or snapshot package.

<p>
Now then, if you are still experiencing problems with the latest, up to date
SVN copy, check out the
<a href="bugreports.html">FFmpeg bug report page</a>. Providing the
kind of information requested on that page helps the developers help you
with the problem you are reporting. It saves time for everyone. Simply
writing "It does not work!" is remarkably useless and inevitably leads to
an exchange where the developers must ask you to visit the bug reporting
page anyway.

<p>

After you have a good bug report, subscribe to and email the
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-user">ffmpeg-user list</a>.

<p>
<b>Want to participate in the active development of FFmpeg?</b> Keep up
with the latest developments by subscribing to both the
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel">ffmpeg-devel</a> and
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-cvslog">ffmpeg-cvslog</a> lists.
If you send us a patch, please make it a unified diff (diff -u), everything
else is unusable. For more detailed guidelines, have a look at the
<a href="http://mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/patches.txt">MPlayer patch guidelines</a>
most of what is written there applies to FFmpeg as well.

<h3>Mailling list archives</h3>

<p>
To read up on past discussions, read the mailing list archives. It is highly
likely that you will find an answer to your questions there, so make sure to
browse the archives before posting questions.

<h3>IRC channel</h3>

<p>
FFmpeg has an official channel on the <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>
IRC network: <b>#ffmpeg</b>
</p>

<p>
The channel is open and unmoderated, developers with SVN write access have
operator status, contributors that committed patches get voice.
