<h1>FFmpeg Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>
Please follow the netiquette when posting on FFmpeg mailing lists, especially
avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">top-posting</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_hijacking">thread hijacking</a>.
If you attach files, avoid compressing small files, uncompressed is preferred.
Also please try to avoid posting mails with overly long signatures or nonsense
corporate disclaimers that claim the content of your mails is confidential.
Attached patches should not have application/octet-stream as mime-type.
Trespass these rules at the risk of being flamed.

<p>
<b>Need help with FFmpeg?</b> First, this very important question:

<p><strong>Are you using the latest SVN version of FFmpeg?</strong></p>

Seriously, FFmpeg is in a state of perpetual development and "official"
releases are highly infrequent and largely a formality. The releases do
not reflect the state of the FFmpeg's current technology. You should be using
the latest SVN checkout or snapshot package.

<p><strong>Have you compiled FFmpeg with<code>--enable-libfaac
--enable-libfaad --enable-libmp3lame</code>?</strong></p>

Most of the times you are missing an AAC encoder/decoder or an MP3 encoder.
Make sure you compile FFmpeg with these flags before you ask for help.

<p>
Now then, if you are still experiencing problems with the latest, up to date
SVN copy, check out the
<a href="bugreports.html">FFmpeg bug report page</a>. Providing the
kind of information requested on that page helps the developers help you
with the problem you are reporting. It saves time for everyone. Simply
writing "It does not work!" is remarkably useless and inevitably leads to
an exchange where the developers must ask you to visit the bug reporting
page anyway.

<p>

After you have a good bug report, submit it to our bug tracker.

<p>
<b>Want to participate in the active development of FFmpeg?</b> Keep up
with the latest developments by subscribing to both the
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel">ffmpeg-devel</a> and
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-cvslog">ffmpeg-cvslog</a> lists.
If you send us a patch, please make it a unified diff (diff -u), everything
else is unusable. For more detailed guidelines, have a look at the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/patches.txt">MPlayer patch guidelines</a>
most of what is written there applies to FFmpeg as well.

<h2>Mailing list archives</h2>

<p>
To read up on past discussions, read the mailing list archives. It is highly
likely that you will find an answer to your questions there, so make sure to
browse the archives before posting questions.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-cvslog/">ffmpeg-cvslog archives</a> This list contains the changes to FFmpeg source.
<br>
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/">ffmpeg-devel archives</a> This list is for development of FFmpeg and libav* librarys. NOT the development of software that use FFmpeg librarys.
<br>
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/">ffmpeg-user archives</a> This list is for regular user questions and development with the FFmpeg librarys.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://gmane.org">Gmane</a> also has
<a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.cvs">ffmpeg-cvslog</a>
and
<a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel">ffmpeg-devel</a>
and
<a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.user">ffmpeg-user</a>
and
<a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.issues">ffmpeg-issues</a>
archives.
</p>


<h2>IRC channels</h2>

<p>
FFmpeg has two official channels on the <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>
IRC network. Both channels are open and unmoderated. Developers with SVN
write access have operator status, contributors with patches in FFmpeg
have voice in the channels.
</p>

<p>
<b>#ffmpeg</b> is for user support and general questions similar to the
ffmpeg-user mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<b>#ffmpeg-devel</b> is strictly dedicated to FFmpeg development. This
means development of FFmpeg itself. Development of other software that uses
the FFmpeg libraries is offtopic there.
