<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>
Please follow the netiquette when posting on FFmpeg mailing lists, especially
avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting">top-posting</a> and
thread hijacking (that is, replying to a thread and changing the subject line to
something completely unrelated that was not being discussed within the original
thread).
Configuring your mail client to break lines after 70 or so characters is a plus.
If you attach files, avoid compressing small files, uncompressed is preferred.
Also please try to avoid posting mails with overly long signatures or nonsense
corporate disclaimers that claim the content of your mails is confidential.
</p>
<p>
Attached patches should not have application/octet-stream as mime-type, but
text/plain or even better text/x-diff or text/x-patch.
If you send us a patch, please make it some form of unified diff. We prefer
patches made using <code>svn diff &gt; submission.diff</code> from the root of
your FFmpeg checkout, but we also accept git patches. For more detailed
guidelines, have a look at the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/patches.txt">MPlayer patch guidelines</a>
most of what is written there applies to FFmpeg as well.
Trespass these rules at the risk of being flamed.

<h2>IRC channels</h2>

<p>
FFmpeg has two official channels on the <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>
IRC network. Both channels are open and unmoderated. Developers with commit
rights have operator status, contributors with patches in FFmpeg
have voice in the channels.
</p>

<p>
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/ffmpeg"><b>#ffmpeg</b></a> is for user support
and general questions similar to the ffmpeg-user mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/ffmpeg-devel"><b>#ffmpeg-devel</b></a> is
strictly dedicated to FFmpeg development. This means development of FFmpeg
itself. Development of other software that uses the FFmpeg libraries is offtopic
there.
