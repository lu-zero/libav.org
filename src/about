<h1>About Libav</h1>

<p> Libav is friendly and community driven effort to provide its users
with a set of portable, functional and performant libraries for dealing
with multimedia formats of all sorts. It originates from the <a
href="http://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> codebase, but goes its own way these
days, providing its users with reliable releases and a clear vision how
to go forward. </p>

<h2>Releases</h2>

<p> We are committed to provide major releases yearly and point releases
at least on a quaterly rate. We try to maintain at least two major release
at time (currently 0.5 and 0.6), while developing the next one (0.7). </p>

<h3>Point releases</h3>

<p> Point releases will contain mostly bugfixes and performance improvements.
The API and ABI will remain stable and only few features might get added.
The focus is to provide a stable foundation. We suggest distributions to
provide point releases.</p>

<h3>Major releases</h3>

<p> On major releases we expect to have disruptive changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li> All the deprecated functions will be removed </li>
    <li> Libraries and headers might get added or removed </li>
    <li> The behaviour of the provided tools will change </li>
</ul>

<p> In order to make the transition as smooth as possible, the removal of
deprecated function can span more than whole release cycle.</p>
<p> Currently 0.7 will replace and deprecate most of the buffered and
unbuffered IO subsystem functions, the 0.6 compatibility will be preserved
until the 0.8 release. </p>

<h3>Snapshots</h3>

<p> Our master branch should be always in an almost stable condition, we
provide a quite large regression testing framework and we monitor its
<a href="http://fate.libav.org"
   title="FATE Automated Testing Environment">reports</a>
to make sure everything is working as expected on a wide variety of systems.
We advise to check <a href="http://fate.libav.org" title="FATE Automated Testing Environment">FATE</a> before distributing a snapshot or run it yourself.</p>
<p> If you are not represented yet in <a href="http://fate.libav.org" title="FATE Automated Testing Environment">FATE</a> and you have the resources to provide
reports please contact us. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p> We strive to implement and provide useful and innovative features in
a timely fashion, provide stable release and interact to the best of our
abilities with our downstream such as distributors and end users. For
instance, most of the ffmpeg-mt work has been merged into Libav <a
href="http://git.libav.org/?p=libav.git;a=commit;h=37b00b47cbeecd66bb34c5c7c534d016d6e8da24">
for quite some time</a>. This work is still ongoing, we are still
working hard to fix the remaining issues such as with multi-threaded
h264 decoding. </p>

<p> We are not afraid to overhaul radically our code in order to provide a
better foundation for future works and we prefer to spend effort to get
clean code right instead of piling up special cases and heuristics. </p>

<p> We are patient enough to track bugs and corner cases until they are
completely solved </p>

<p> With the help of our users we try to improve the experience of using
both the libraries and the tools </p>

<p> We try to focus both on real world issues as well on experiments that
might lead to new interesting outcomes. </p>

<p> We are happy to learn that the now arisen competition has finally
lead FFmpeg to merge important and long requested features such as <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/129927">
frame based multi-threaded decoding</a> based on
<a href="http://gitorious.org/~astrange/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-mt/">ffmpeg-mt</a>,
something the project leader strongly refused to merge during our attempts to
reconcile with him. </p>

<h1>Organization of Libav</h1>

<h2>Committers</h2>

<p> We started with a small number of committers for practical
reasons. One bad example we had in mind was the experience with the
MythTV project where inexperienced git users made a lot of beginner
errors after the switch. The likely consequence is that the project will
switch back to Subversion.  </p>

<p> The list of committers was chosen for multiple reasons. One is
available time, the committers must do a lot of patch monkeying and
should be able to ensure that the patch queue does not slow down
development. Another is git experience, we wish to avoid mistakes and
the fate of MythTV. </p>

<p> While the initial committers are trusted and mostly experienced with
git, mistakes are inevitable. The point is not that the committers be
infallible and incapable of making mistakes but rather that there should
be fewer mistakes and when mistakes occur, that they be fixed quickly
and effectively.  </p>

<p> The list of committers is not fixed and we continue to extend
it. New patch monkeys will be chosen by trust and competence through
consensus in the current committer team. Committers are trusted not to
break the review rules. Being a committer is a duty, not a privilege.
</p>


<h2>Review process</h2>

<p> Reviews should be done on a best-effort basis by a person competent
in the area touched by the patch. The rule "no commits without review"
ensures that another set of qualified eyes looks over code prior to
commit. Adopting that policy for all developers - maintainers,
committers or first time contributors - puts everybody on equal footing.
</p>

<p> If a patch touches a part of Libav that nobody knows well, then
review is still done on a best-effort basis. In such a case it is not
possible to guarantee the same quality as when expert (in the field)
reviewers are available, but general code quality and portability can
still be maintained. A review shall then verify that the code does what
the author intended and that the change is sensible and beneficial.
</p>

<p> We aim to make the lifetime of a patch or a branch minimal. To this
end, the amount of nitpicking on patches should be
minimized. Documentation typos or small coding style errors can be
changed by committers without a new round of review or a new patch
submission by the original contributor. Likewise, large patches should
not live in separate branches forever. Instead, committers and reviewers
should actively reach out to integrate branches into the main tree
(i.e. we want to avoid another ffmpeg-mt situation).  </p>


<h2>Personal Conflict Resolution</h2>

<p> Personal conflicts shall be assisted by mediators.
When a conflict between two (or more) people arises and
threatens to spiral downwards, anybody may ask for a mediator to step
in. The role of the mediator is to pull the fighters apart, calm them
down, listen to each side and try to restore and aid civil communication
towards a resolution.  </p>

<p> If reasonable communication fails, a mediator can ask for people to
be moderated on the mailing lists so that mails arrive with a delay and
combatants have a chance to calm down. Suitable mediator candidates
should be calm, level-headed, respected and more or less neutral in the
topic at hand. Being uncontroversial as a person and being a good
communicator is a plus. </p>


<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

In order to foster a friendly and cooperative atmosphere where technical
collaboration can flourish we expect all members of the Libav community to be

<ul>
<li> courteous, polite and respectful in their treatment of others, </li>
<li> helpful and constructive in suggestions and criticism, </li>
<li> stay on topic for the communication medium that is being used, </li>
<li> be tolerant of differences in opinion and mistakes that inevitably get
  made by everyone. </li>
</ul>

Plus, we expect everybody to not

<ul>
<li>  flame and troll, </li>
<li>  insult, </li>
<li>  be offtopic or </li>
<li>  disruptive of our communication channels. </li>
</ul>

While we hope to keep disciplinary action to a minimum, repeated violations of
this policy will result in offenders getting temporarily or permanently removed
from our communication channels.

<h1>History</h1>

<p> As an attempt to help with the confusion around the recent
happenings around FFmpeg, this article presents our views on the
situation.  </p>

<h2>Some Background</h2>

<p> A significant number of
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/123868">
<b>active</b> FFmpeg developers</a> feel very unhappy about the way
FFmpeg was driven and managed in general and were particularly unhappy
with the project leader. Many attempts to resolve and reconcile the
issues internally were attempted but unfortunately, all of them failed.
</p>

<p> Over the last few years, more and more flames and bickering spread
over the ffmpeg-devel mailing list. Important features and fixes were
delayed or outright rejected on the grounds of not being
perfect. Moreover, project and review rules were applied very
inconsistently. Many people were angered and demotivated by this, up to
the point of abandoning the project.  </p>

<p> In 2010 the situation escalated. A controversial commit resulted in
a vote over the leadership position. The result was that the leader
would stay, but must follow the same rules as everybody else and amend
his behavior. The surrounding flames resulted in one of the most active
and experienced developers leaving the project. Multiple developers
tried to compose the situation by mediating between the disgruntled and
demotivated developers and the project leader.  </p>

<p> A few months later we came to the conclusion that the situation had
not changed for the better. At first, we decided against forking because
most active developers expressed their interest to join it, including
the server administrators. We therefore tried to <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/423702/"> preserve the project as it
was</a>. The ensuing flames were expected, but unfortunately a number of
people who had not been actively following the discussions protested and
sided for the former leader. For a time there were two trees sharing one
mailing list, IRC channel with much hostility between them.  </p>

<h2>The founding of libav.org</h2>

<p> Later we have learned that the FFmpeg founder, who owns the domain,
still favors the now-demoted project leader. We of course respect his
opinion, which convinced us to fork "properly" under the name Libav with
its own website, mailing lists, IRC channel and repositories, thus
completely separating from the old FFmpeg project. In it, we hope to
accomplish what was missing in the former development process -- a
friendly environment, free of pointless flames over trivialities, for
making THE multimedia library even better than it is now.  </p>
