<h1>Reporting a Bug To The Libav Project</h1>

<p>
When writing your bug report, please include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What you were trying to accomplish (e.g., "I am trying to transcode
    from this format to that format...")</li>
  <li>The problem you encountered (e.g., "<code>avconv</code> crashed" or "The
    output video was all green")</li>
  <li>The exact command line you were using (e.g., "<code>avconv -i input.mov
    -an -c:v foo output.avi</code>")</li>
  <li>The full, uncut console output provided by
    <code>avconv -v 9 -loglevel 99 -i </code> followed by the name of your input file
    (copy/pasted from the console, including the banner that indicates
    version and configuration options), paste <code>avplay</code> output
    only if your problem is not reproducible with avconv.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you encounter a crash bug, please provide the <code>gdb</code> output,
backtrace and disassembly using an unstripped <code>avconv</code> binary as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>gdb avconv</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In <code>gdb</code>, type 'r' for run, along with the rest of the
<code>avconv</code> command line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>r &lt;rest of command line&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
When <code>gdb</code> encounters its problem, run the following commands and
copy/paste the output into your bug report:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
bt
disass $pc-32,$pc+32
info all-registers
</pre>
</blockquote>

For gdb versions before 7.1, you need to employ a slightly different
syntax for the above <code>disass</code> command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
disass $pc-32 $pc+32
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If gdb does not provide useful information please try to use
<a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a> to trace possible memory
corruption.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
valgrind avconv &lt;rest of command line&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once you have gathered this information, you can submit a report to the
<a href="https://bugzilla.libav.org/">Libav bug tracker</a>. You
should provide all information so that anyone can reproduce the bug.
</p>


<h2>Submitting Sample Media</h2>

<p>
The developers may ask you to provide a sample media file illustrating
your problem. In this case, please follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the sample file is too large ( &gt; 10 megabytes), cut it down to
    size with the Unix 'dd' command:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>dd if=sample-file of=small-sample-file bs=1024 count=10000</pre>
      </blockquote>
    and then upload small-sample-file rather than sample-file</li>
  <li>Please choose descriptive names like "h264_green_tint.mov" or
      "block_artifacts_after_seeking.mkv". We already have plenty of "bug.rm"
      and "sample.avi" to choose from.</li>
  <li>Upload the sample to the Libav FTP server. Note that our FTP server
    is write-only in order to prevent abuses. Do not let this confuse you.
    Even though you cannot see the file you uploaded, it will be there and
    the Libav developers will have access.
  <ul>
    <li>Log into upload.libav.org with an anonymous FTP login.</li>
    <li>cd -> incoming</li>
    <li>Create a new directory.</li>
    <li>cd -> your new directory</li>
    <li>Upload a brief text file describing the sample and what is wrong.
        <b>This is important!</b> If you leave out the text file it would
        be harder for us to figure out where to archive it.</li>
    <li>Upload the sample.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email the list and indicate the location of the sample.</li>
</ul>
