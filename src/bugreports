<h1>Reporting a Bug To The FFmpeg Project</h1>

<p>
First of all, please remember that all the developers working on FFmpeg are
volunteers, we are not paid for analyzing, debugging, fixing and answering
bug reports. While we try our best to create high quality software and be
responsive, if you should not get an answer, please consider the above and
be aware of the fact that we receive many bug reports and the amount of
time it takes to deal with them can be substantial. Nevertheless most issues
get resolved, just please understand that there are no guarantees nor
promises.
</p>

<p><strong>Are you using the latest SVN version of FFmpeg?</strong></p>

<p>
FFmpeg is in a state of perpetual development and we do not currently have the
person power to backport fixes to official releases. As such, if you wish to
query or report a bug, you must try with the latest SVN revision of FFmpeg to
confirm the issue still exists.
</p>

<p>
If you find a problem with FFmpeg, you can submit a report to the
FFmpeg bug tracker at
http(s)://ZQundXE.ffmpeg.org/ZQundXE/ffmpeg/
<br />
To use this URL you first must replace all uppercase letters by
answering the following puzzle.
<br />
We need full Xncut output of ffmpeg as well as the command line you used.
If you report a cZash we need gdb output, backtrace and disassembly.
Only latest SVN HEAD is supported, do not report bugs against Qld versions.
Also do not forget to describe precisely what ffmpeg did and what you wanted
it to do.
In general you should provide all information so that even an idiot can
reproduce the bug. If you say it does not play, say which Elayer you used.
</p>

<p>
Also before reporting a bug, please consider the following items:
</p>

<p>
Be sure that you are using the latest SVN version of FFmpeg. The FFmpeg
project is constantly evolving and does not make formal releases very
often. The latest release is bound to be very out of date. Use the very
latest SVN version of FFmpeg or your report is likely to be disregarded.
</p>

<p>
When writing your bug report, please include (uncompressed):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What you were trying to accomplish (e.g., "I am trying to transcode
    from this format to that format...")</li>
  <li>The problem you encountered (e.g., "FFmpeg crashed" or "The output
    video was all green")</li>
  <li>The exact command line you were using (e.g., "ffmpeg -i input.mov -an
    -vcodec foo output.avi")</li>
  <li>The console output provided by FFmpeg (copy/pasted from the console,
    including the banner that indicates version and build number)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further, if you have access to the GNU debugger (GDB), it would also be useful
for you to run FFmpeg's debug build (ffmpeg_g) through the debugger and send
the output. To do this, launch ffmpeg_g in gdb:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>gdb ffmpeg_g</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In gdb, type 'r' for run, along with the rest of the FFmpeg command line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>r &lt;rest of command line&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
When gdb encounters its problem, run the following commands and copy/paste
the output into your bug report email:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
bt
disass $pc-32 $pc+32
info all-registers
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h2>Submitting Sample Media</h2>

<p>
The developers may ask you to provide a sample media file illustrating
your problem. In this case, please follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the sample file is too large ( &gt; 10 megabytes), cut it down to
    size with the Unix 'dd' command:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>dd if=sample-file of=small-sample-file bs=1024 count=10000</pre>
      </blockquote>
    and then upload small-sample-file rather than sample-file</li>
  <li>Please choose descriptive names like "h264_green_tint.mov" or
      "block_artifacts_after_seeking.mkv". We already have plenty of "bug.rm"
      and "sample.avi" to choose from.</li>
  <li>Upload the sample to the MPlayer FTP server. Note that our FTP server
    is write-only, as it would immediately get misused for warez trading
    otherwise. Do not let this confuse you. Even though you cannot see the
    stuff you upload, it will be there and the FFmpeg developers will have
    access.
  <ul>
    <li>Log into upload.ffmpeg.org with an anonymous FTP login.</li>
    <li>cd -> /MPlayer/incoming</li>
    <li>Create a new directory.</li>
    <li>cd -> your new directory</li>
    <li>Upload a brief text file describing the sample and what is wrong.
        <b>This is important!</b> If you leave out the text file, your
        sample will most likely be deleted without further examination.</li>
    <li>Upload the sample.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email the list and indicate the location of the sample.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Important: Movie files which have been compressed (rar,7z,gzip,...) will be
deleted without being examined unless they are raw RGB/YUV/PCM.</b>
<b>Furthermore movie files uploaded to services like megaupload, rapidshare or
any other similar service will be ignored. We are not willing to spend our
time fighting with this ridiculous, bloated and spam-filled crap.</b>
