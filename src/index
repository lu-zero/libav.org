<a name="linuxtag_2010"></a><h3>June 2, 2010</h3>
<p>
We are pleased to announce that FFmpeg will be present at LinuxTag in
Berlin June 9-12 where we will be showing some spectacular demos.
There will also be some trolls.
</p>

<a name="release_0.5.2"></a><h3>May 25, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have just pushed out another point release from our 0.5 release branch:
<a href="download.html#release">FFmpeg 0.5.2</a></b>.
This is a maintenance-only release that addresses a small number of security
and portability issues. Distributors and system integrators are encouraged
to update and share their patches against this branch.
</p>

<a name="gsoc_2010"></a><h3>March 19, 2010</h3>
<p>
Once again, FFmpeg has been accepted to take part in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Here is the
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/show/google/gsoc2010/ffmpeg">Google SoC
FFmpeg page</a>.
</p>
<p>
We have a list of
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=FFmpeg_Summer_Of_Code_2010">
proposed project ideas</a> available so, if you think you might be interested,
head over there to see if there is any project on which you wish to work and for
which you may wish to make an application. The list is still in flux, and you're
free to come up with your own ideas, but note that proposals should be closely
tied to the progression of FFmpeg's code base.
</p>
<p>
We would like prospective students to show us that they've got what it takes
to be a contributor to FFmpeg. If you think you're suited, then please complete
a <a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Small_FFmpeg_Tasks">small
task</a> before submitting your Summer-of-Code proposal. Note that many of the
proposed Summer-of-Code projects have specific tasks that you would want to work
on, since they would show us that you're comfortable in that particular piece of
our codebase that relates to your specific project. Send patches to the mailing
list for review, so that you will learn about our patch review process,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Inline_replying">inline
replying</a> (because we don't like top-posting on our mailing lists) and general
interactions with our developer base.
</p>
<p>
The sooner you start communicating with us and working within
our code base, the sooner both you and we will ascertain your suitability and
you will get used to our development methodology. You have until the application
deadline to complete your small task. Good luck!
</p>

<a name="release_0.5.1"></a><h3>March 2, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have just pushed out a point release from our 0.5 release
branch: <a href="download.html#release">FFmpeg 0.5.1</a></b>. This
release fixes security, packaging and licensing issues for FFmpeg 0.5,
but it is a maintenance only release; no new codecs, formats or other
feature are being introduced. The full details are spelled out in the
the <a href="releases/ffmpeg-0.5.1.release">release notes</a>
and <a href="releases/ffmpeg-0.5.1.changelog">changelog</a>.
</p>

<p>
There have been security fixes for the ASF, Ogg and MOV/MP4 demuxers
as well as the FFv1, H.264, HuffYUV, MLP, MPEG audio and Snow
decoders. libswscale can now be compiled in LGPL mode, albeit with
x86 optimizations disabled. Some non-free bits in a test program were
replaced. The AC-3 decoder is now completely LGPL. AMR-NB/WB support
is now possible in free software through the OpenCORE libraries.
</p>

<p>
To help packagers, the x264 glue code was updated to work with newer
versions and symbol versioning was backported, as was the lock
management API. The symbol versioning change is enabled on platforms
that support it. This allows users to upgrade from 0.5.1 to the
upcoming 0.6 release without having to recompile their applications.
While this release is both API and ABI compatible with 0.5, please
note that distributors have to recompile applications against 0.5.1
in order to make seamless upgrades to 0.6 possible.
</p>


<h3>March 1, 2010</h3>
<p>
We have been busy over the past few months. Among other things, the
results are an Indeo 5 video decoder as well as audio decoders for
AMR-NB, Sipro, MPEG-4 ALS and WMA Voice, complete support for Bink,
CDG and IFF PBM/ILBM bitmaps, an RTSP muxer, Bluray (PGS) subtitle
support, a protocol for file concatenation and the ffprobe tool for
extracting information from multimedia files.
</p>

<h3>September 23, 2009</h3>
<p>
In 1992 Sony introduced the first Minidisc player. 17 years later it is now
possible to transfer and play back the raw ATRAC data from the actual digital
disc with the help of FFmpeg, tools developed by the
<a href="https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php">Linux
 Minidisc project</a> and official hardware (MZ-RH1). So if you have lots of digital
recordings stored on Minidisc now is the time to archive it all.
</p>

<p>
One of the last entrenchments of proprietary multimedia has fallen: Windows Media
Audio Pro support is finally available in FFmpeg. It decodes all known samples
flawlessly and is considerably faster than the binary decoder from Microsoft.
A big thank you goes out to all the reverse engineers and programmers who made
this possible. It really was a herculean effort.
</p>


<h3>August 24, 2009</h3>
<p>
Just a very short time after its launch (~10 years), FFmpeg now supports
decoding of TwinVQ (remember .vqf files?). Now FOSS enthusiasts can finally
contribute to the late 90's discussion if it sounds better than MP3 or not.
</p>

<h3>July 24, 2009</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg has removed support for
<a href="http://www.penguin.cz/~utx/amr">libamr</a> as of svn revision 19365. It
has been replaced with support for
<a href="http://opencore-amr.sourceforge.net/">libopencore-amr</a>. Naturally
the configure options have changed. The libamr options have been removed and
there are two new options to take their place:
</p>
<ul>
<li>--enable-libopencore-amrnb</li>
<li>--enable-libopencore-amrwb</li>
</ul>
<p>
The reason for this change is that the libamr license was non-free, while
libopencore-amr is licensed under an Apache 2 license. The change was
<a href="http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2009-May/069779.html">
discussed at length</a> on the developer mailing list during May, June, and
July. This has several effects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You may now distribute FFmpeg builds with support for dynamically loading
    libopencore-amr</li>
<li>Support for AMR-WB encoding has been removed since libopencore-amr does not
    support it</li>
</ul>

<h3>May 7, 2009</h3>

<h3>March 4, 2009</h3>
<p>
Google are again running their <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of
Code</a> program and, as usual, we will be applying for a project position. As
such we will need strong
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=FFmpeg_Summer_Of_Code_2009">
project proposals</a> and qualification tasks for the students to complete.
</p>
<p>
To all the students out there who want to work on FFmpeg over the summer, the
sooner you begin to contribute to the project the better. Working on digital
multimedia software is not the easiest task and getting code into FFmpeg's trunk
repository demands significant rigor and commitment.
</p>
<p>
Until we are officially accepted into the program, you could take a look at the
list of
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Small_FFmpeg_Tasks">small
tasks</a> we have and try to complete one of those. Support for development of
FFmpeg is available via <a href="contact.html">the FFmpeg-devel mailing list or
IRC</a>.
</p>

<h3>December 20, 2008</h3>
<p>
RealVideo 3.0 decoder added.
Still working the bugs out, please test and report any problems.
</p>

<h3>December 20, 2008</h3>
<p>
The FFmpeg project would like to recognize
and thank the people at <a href="http://www.picsearch.com/">Picsearch</a>
for their help improving FFmpeg recently. The Picsearch team makes extensive
use of FFmpeg and provided feedback to FFmpeg in the form of thousands of files
that either crash FFmpeg or use unsupported/unknown codecs. The FFmpeg
development team is putting this information to work in order to improve
FFmpeg for everyone.
</p>

<p>
We know that there are other organizations using FFmpeg on a large scale
to process diverse input types. The FFmpeg team invites those
organizations to provide similar feedback about problems encountered in
the wild.
</p>

<h3>December 3, 2008</h3>
<p>
A bunch of new formats have recently been
added to FFmpeg, namely a QCELP/PureVoice speech decoder, a floating point
PCM decoder and encoder, a Nellymoser ASAO encoder, an Electronic Arts TGQ
decoder, Speex decoding via libspeex, an MXF muxer, an ASS/SSA subtitle demuxer
and muxer and our AC-3 decoder has been extended with E-AC-3 support. Last but
not least we now have a decoder for RealVideo 4.0.
</p>

<h3>September 8, 2008</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg is undergoing major changes in its
API/ABI. The last valid revision for libavcodec version 51 is r15261.
</p>

<h3>August 21, 2008</h3>
<p>
The AAC decoder from FFmpeg Summer of Code
2006 has finally been cleaned up and is now in FFmpeg trunk. It supports Main
and Low Complexity profile AAC but does not yet support HE AAC v1 (LC + SBR) or
v2 (LC + SBR + PS), though implementation of this support is underway. It is
considerably faster than FAAD and you should expect further performance
improvements and bug fixes in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
Also, FFmpeg now has floating point PCM support and supports MLP/TrueHD decoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008 should bring us an encoder), Apple Lossless Audio encoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008) MVI demuxing and Motion Pixels Video decoding, D-Cinema audio
muxing, Electronic Arts CMV and TGV decoding and MAXIS EA XA demuxing/decoding.
</p>

<h3>June 16, 2008</h3>
<p>
UAB "DKD" (dkd.lt) have released a Nellymoser
ASAO compatible <a href="http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/A-codecs/Nelly_Moser/ASAO/ASAO.zip">decoder and
encoder</a> under the LGPL. This will aid the development of a native encoder in
FFmpeg, and right now a GSoC student is working hard on just that task. A great
thanks to UAB "DKD" for this contribution to the FFmpeg community.
</p>

<h3>June 11, 2008</h3>
<p>
We have added an Oma demuxer, the QuickTime
variant of an IMA ADPCM encoder, a VFW grabber, an iPod/iPhone-compatible MP4
muxer, a Mimic decoder, an MSN TCP Webcam stream demuxer as well as demuxers
and decoders for the following fringe formats: RL2, IFF, 8SVX, BFI.
</p>

<h3>February 7, 2008</h3>
<p>
We have added Ogg and AVM2 (Flash 9)
SWF muxers, TechnoTrend PVA and Linux Media Labs MPEG-4 (LMLM4) demuxers,
PC Paintbrush PCX and Sun Rasterfile decoders.
</p>

<h3>November 11, 2007</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg now supports XIntra8 frames,
meaning that finally all WMV2 samples and some WMV3 samples that showed
blocky color artifacts can be decoded correctly.
</p>

<h3>October 22, 2007</h3>
<p>
Beam Software SIFF demuxer and video decoder
support added.
</p>

<h3>October 15, 2007</h3>
<p>
FFmpeg gets support for the Nellymoser
speech codec used in flash.
</p>

<h3>October 9, 2007</h3>
<p>
Apart from a DNxHD encoder, PAFF decoding
support for H.264 was committed to SVN.
</p>

<h3>September 29, 2007</h3>
<p>
AMV audio and video decoding has arrived.
</p>

<h3>September 13, 2007</h3>
<p>
In about half a year of work since the
last update we have added among other things: DXA and Monkey's Audio demuxer
and decoder, DNxHD, Atrac3 and AC-3 decoders, QTRLE encoder, NUT and Matroska
muxers.
</p>

<h3>July 14, 2007</h3>
<p>
