<h1>Project Description</h1>

<b>FFmpeg</b> is a complete solution to record, convert and stream
audio and video. It includes <b>libavcodec</b>, the leading
audio/video codec library. FFmpeg is developed under Linux, but it
can be compiled under most operating systems, including Windows.

<p>The project is made of several components:
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>ffmpeg</tt> is a command line tool to convert one video file
format to another. It also supports grabbing and encoding in real time
from a TV card.</li>

<li><tt>ffserver</tt> is an HTTP (RTSP is being developed) multimedia
streaming server for live broadcasts. Time shifting of live broadcast
is also supported.</li>

<li><tt>ffplay</tt> is a simple media player based on <a
href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> and on the FFmpeg libraries.</li>

<li><tt>libavcodec</tt> is a library containing all the FFmpeg
audio/video encoders and decoders. Most codecs were developed from
scratch to ensure best performances and high code reusability.</li>

<li><tt>libavformat</tt> is a library containing parsers and
generators for all common audio/video formats.</li>

</ul>

As always, check the <a href="ffmpeg-doc.html">main FFmpeg doc</a> for a
complete feature list, and the <a href="changelog.html">Changelog for recent
changes</a>.

<h1>News</h1>

<strong>(December 3, 2008)</strong> A bunch of new formats have recently been
added to FFmpeg, namely a QCELP/PureVoice speech decoder, a floating point
PCM decoder and encoder, a Nellymoser ASAO encoder, an Electronic Arts TGQ
decoder, Speex decoding via libspeex, an MXF muxer, an ASS/SSA subtitle demuxer
and muxer and our AC-3 decoder has been extended with E-AC-3 support. Last but
not least we now have a decoder for RealVideo 4.0.

<p>

<strong>(September 8, 2008)</strong> FFmpeg is undergoing major changes in its
API/ABI. The last valid revision for libavcodec version 51 is r15261.

<p>

<strong>(August 21, 2008)</strong> The AAC decoder from FFmpeg Summer of Code
2006 has finally been cleaned up and is now in FFmpeg trunk. It supports Main
and Low Complexity profile AAC but does not yet support HE AAC v1 (LC + SBR) or
v2 (LC + SBR + PS), though implementation of this support is underway. It is
considerably faster than FAAD and you should expect further performance
improvements and bug fixes in the coming weeks.
<p>
Also, FFmpeg now has floating point PCM support and supports MLP/TrueHD decoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008 should bring us an encoder), Apple Lossless Audio encoding
(FFmpeg SoC 2008) MVI demuxing and Motion Pixels Video decoding, D-Cinema audio
muxing, Electronic Arts CMV and TGV decoding and MAXIS EA XA demuxing/decoding.

<p>

<strong>(June 16, 2008)</strong> UAB "DKD" (dkd.lt) have released a
Nellymoser ASAO compatible
<a href="http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/ASAO/ASAO.zip">decoder and encoder</a>
under the LGPL. This will aid the development of a native encoder in FFmpeg,
and right now a GSoC student is working hard on just that task. A great
thanks to UAB "DKD" for this contribution to the FFmpeg community.

<p>

<strong>(June 11, 2008)</strong> We have added an Oma demuxer, the QuickTime
variant of an IMA ADPCM encoder, a VFW grabber, an iPod/iPhone-compatible MP4
muxer, a Mimic decoder, an MSN TCP Webcam stream demuxer as well as demuxers
and decoders for the following fringe formats: RL2, IFF, 8SVX, BFI.

<p>

<strong>(February 7, 2008)</strong> We have added Ogg and AVM2 (Flash 9)
SWF muxers, TechnoTrend PVA and Linux Media Labs MPEG-4 (LMLM4) demuxers,
PC Paintbrush PCX and Sun Rasterfile decoders.

<p>

<strong>(November 11, 2007)</strong> FFmpeg now supports XIntra8 frames,
meaning that finally all WMV2 samples and some WMV3 samples that showed
blocky color artifacts can be decoded correctly.

<p>

<strong>(October 22, 2007)</strong> Beam Software SIFF demuxer and video decoder support added.

<p>

<strong>(October 15, 2007)</strong> FFmpeg gets support for the Nellymoser speech codec used in flash.

<p>

<strong>(October 9, 2007)</strong> Apart from a DNxHD encoder, PAFF decoding
support for H.264 was committed to SVN.

<p>

<strong>(September 29, 2007)</strong> AMV audio and video decoding has arrived.

<p>

<strong>(September 13, 2007)</strong> In about half a year of work since the
last update we have added among other things: DXA and Monkey's Audio demuxer
and decoder, DNxHD, Atrac3 and AC-3 decoders, QTRLE encoder, NUT and Matroska
muxers.

<p>

<strong>(July 14, 2007)</strong> FFmpeg got 8 projects this year in the Google Summer of Code program.
Check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/about.html">FFmpeg SoC about page</a> for
more information.

<p>

<strong>(March 09, 2007)</strong> Nine months without news but with heavy
development. A few select highlights are decoders for VC-1/WMV3/WMV9, VMware,
VP5, VP6 video and WavPack, IMC, DCA audio and a WMA encoder.

<p>

<strong>(June 01, 2006)</strong> FFmpeg got 5 projects in the Google Summer of Code program.
Check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/about.html">FFmpeg SoC about page</a> for
more information about the 5 projects.

<p>


<strong>(June 01, 2006)</strong> FFmpeg CVS to SVN transition is completed. The CVS server
is now retired.

<p>

<strong>(May 02, 2006)</strong> FFmpeg is participating in this year's
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
If you are interested, check out the
<a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=FFmpeg_Summer_Of_Code">list of possible projects</a>
on the multimedia wiki.

<p>

<strong>(May 02, 2006)</strong> FFmpeg will be present at
<a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2006/">LinuxTag 2006</a>
with a few developers. Drop by the Free Video booth to meet us.

<p>

<strong>(October 16, 2005)</strong> Recent FFmpeg developments include a
native decoder for Duck TrueMotion 2 data. This decoder can handle data from
the popular <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/final-fantasy-vii"><em>Final
Fantasy VII</em> game</a> (Windows port). As usual, check out
<a href="download.html">the latest CVS</a>.

<p>

<strong>(August 17, 2005)</strong> Due to the generous donations of all you
people we have ordered a new server for the project and will have it
running in a few weeks. Look at the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news-archive.html#server_thanks">MPlayer news page</a>
for details. Thank you!

<p>

<strong>(August 6, 2005)</strong> A few days ago the server of the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a> project where FFmpeg is hosted had a
serious failure. We are now looking for donations to get a replacement
server and hosting place. If you wish to see FFmpeg continue to prosper,
please contribute. Look at the
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news-archive.html#server_wanted">MPlayer news page</a>
for details.

<p>

<strong>(May 20, 2005)</strong> Notable recent developments:
<ul>
<li>FFmpeg has a <a href="http://www.fraps.com">Fraps
FPS1 video decoder</a>. This video codec has 3 different versions
and this new decoder supports the first 2 versions so far. Stay tuned
for updates.</li>
<li>The libavformat library features a native Ogg demuxer.</li>
<li>FFmpeg's VP3 decoder is implemented correctly. Further, the new Ogg
demuxer is capable of sending <a href="http://www.theora.org">Theora</a>
video packets to the VP3 for decoding. Put another way, FFmpeg supports
Theora video decoding.</li>
<li>FFmpeg now has its own native Vorbis audio decoder
implementation.</li>
</ul>

<strong>(May 5, 2005)</strong> You may have noticed that
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">
Apple's QuickTime Player 7</a> is available for download. As of this writing,
the player is only available for Mac OS X, and the latest QuickTime files are
only viewable on that platform. That is, <strong>unless you are using an
FFmpeg-derived</strong>
multimedia application. Thanks to dedicated multimedia hackers from the FFmpeg
and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html">x264</a> projects, FFmpeg's
libavcodec can already decode the <em>next-generation (buzzword alert!)</em>
H.264 video codec data inside the latest Apple QuickTime files. Along with
the free, open source <a href="http://www.audiocoding.com/">FAAD AAC decoding
library (for the audio track)</a> and a competent QuickTime file demuxer,
open source software is <strong>already equipped</strong> to handle
the <strong>newest multimedia files</strong> on the internet.

<p>
<em>You're welcome.</em> <img alt="smiley" src="smiley3.gif">

<p>

<b>(Mar 6, 2005)</b>
FFmpeg now includes a native decoder for Apple's Lossless Audio Codec
(a.k.a. 'alac'). As usual, check out CVS.

<p>

<b>(Feb 28, 2005)</b>
At least 2 new features recently: Native decoder implementations of both
the Shorten lossless audio codec and the LOCO video codec. Further, finally
added a link to Martin BÃ¶hme's FFmpeg API documentation that so many of you have
already located with search engines. See the <a href="documentation.html">documentation
page</a> for more information.

<p>

<b>(Feb 6, 2005)</b>
Added a new <a href="compat.html">compatibility page</a> to help users
understand which FFmpeg encoding options work best if they
need to interoperate with certain proprietary multimedia players.

<p>

<b>(Jan 24, 2005)</b>
Eagle-eyed observers may have noticed the recent CVS addition of a VC-9
decoding implementation. It is still highly experimental but should eventually
serve as a basis for decoding Microsoft VC-1/VC-9/WMV3/WMV9 video data.

<p>

<b>(Dec 10, 2004)</b>
Here are some of the newest FFmpeg developments:
<ul>
<li>Creative ADPCM audio decoder
<li>Electronic Arts Multimedia (WVE/UV2/etc.) file demuxer
<li>Miro VideoXL (VIXL) video decoder
<li>H.261 video encoder
<li>QPEG video decoder
<li>Nullsoft Video (NSV) file demuxer
</ul>
