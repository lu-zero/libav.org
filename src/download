<h2>FFmpeg Download and SVN</h2>

<?php require ('navbar.html'); ?>

<h3>Getting FFmpeg</h3>
FFmpeg has always been a very experimental and developer-driven project. It
is a key component in many multimedia projects and has new features added
constantly. New, official "releases" are few and far between. In short,
if you want to work with FFmpeg, you are advised to go along with SVN
development rather than relying on formal releases. SVN snapshots work
really well 99% of the time so people are not afraid to use them.

<h3>FFmpeg SVN</h3>
Note that the FFmpeg SVN repository is hosted by
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">the MPlayer project</a>, rather than by
Sourceforge, for... historical reasons. In order to use the standard SVN
client to check out the source code:

<br>
<pre>
  svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg
</pre>
<br>

Alternatively, you can use
<b><a href="http://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk/">the
FFmpeg ViewVC interface</a></b> to browse the source tree online.

<p>
We also provide nightly Subversion snapshots. You can choose between a
<a href="ffmpeg-checkout-snapshot.tar.bz2">full checkout</a> that you
can update with Subversion or
<a href="ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2">bare sources</a> that are
smaller but don't come with Subversion metadata.


<h3>Formal Releases</h3>
If you are looking for a formal release, stop now, there are none.
Maybe we will have some in the future, but don't hold your breath.
