<h1>FFmpeg Download and Source Code Repository Access</h1>

<h2>Getting FFmpeg</h2>
<p>
FFmpeg has always been a very experimental and developer-driven project. It
is a key component in many multimedia projects and has new features added
constantly. Development branch snapshots work really well 99% of the
time so people are not afraid to use them.

Note, the main development branch currently does not support a filter that adds
watermarks to videos, this was removed during switching to a more advanced
filter layer. We are working on resolving this issue. Until then if you need the
watermark filter consider using the latest release from the 0.5 branch. If you
do not need that filter, the development branch is much better than the
releases!  </p>

<h2>FFmpeg Git</h2>
<p>
In order to use the standard Git client to check out the source code:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
git clone git://git.videolan.org/ffmpeg
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, you can
<a href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=summary">browse it online</a>.
</p>

<h2>FFmpeg SVN</h2>
<p><b>
FFmpeg development has moved to a Git repository, and the SVN
repository is no longer updated. The last revision committed to SVN
was r26400 on 2011-01-17.

The SVN repository may be removed in a near future, so you're
recommended to use the Git repository instead.
</b></p>

<p>
In order to use the standard SVN client to check out the source code:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>svn checkout svn://svn.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you cannot access the repository, you are being firewalled somewhere.
Our Subversion setup does <strong>not</strong> work over HTTP/HTTPS, nor
will it in the future. There is no point in asking for it, the decision
is final.
</p>

<p>
We also provide nightly Subversion snapshots that we generate at six in the
morning (GMT+1). You can choose between a
<a href="releases/ffmpeg-checkout-snapshot.tar.bz2">full checkout</a> that you
can update with Subversion or
<a href="releases/ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2">bare sources</a> that are
smaller but don't come with Subversion metadata.

<a name="releases"></a><h1>FFmpeg Releases</h1>

<p>
At irregular intervals FFmpeg makes releases that represent snapshots of FFmpeg
at the moment the release branch was cut. Between major releases point releases
will appear that add important bug fixes but no new features.
Note that these releases are intended for distributors and system integrators.
Users that wish to compile from source themselves are strongly encouraged to
consider using the development branch (see above), this is the only version on
which FFmpeg developers actively work.  The release branches only cherry pick
selected changes from the development branch, which therefore receives much more
and much faster bug fixes such as additional features and security patches.
