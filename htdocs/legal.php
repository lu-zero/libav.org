<H2>FFmpeg License and Legal Considerations</H2>

<?php require ('navbar.html'); ?>

<H3>FFmpeg License</H3>
FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, or LGPL.
Essentially, this means that you are allowed to use the FFmpeg library in
your own application, regardless of your application's license. However, if
you alter the FFmpeg library in any way, <I>and subsequently distribute it</I>,
you are expected to make those changes available under the LGPL license.
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">This is the full text of
the LGPL.</A>

<P>
Be advised that FFmpeg incorporates several modules that are covered under
The GNU General Public License, notably <I>liba52</I> and <I>libpostproc</I>.
If you use these components in your project, you are expected to release your
whole application under the GPL if you distribute your project at all.
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">This is the full text of
the GPL.</A>

<P>
<H3>Trademark</H3>
FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard, originator of the FFmpeg project.

<H3>Legal Mini-FAQ</H3>
A lot of legal questions arise when discussing multimedia technology. This
mini-FAQ attempts to address these issues. Note that much of this discussion
is based on <I>precedent</I>, or what has happened in the past under similar
circumstances. Very little consideration is given to <I>what could happen</I>.
If you use your imagination, you can visualize any dire scenario and cease
doing any productive work.

<P>
<B>Q: Does FFmpeg use proprietary/patented intellectual property?</B>
<BR>
A: Yes. There is a lot of multimedia available in proprietary/patented
formats so it becomes necessary to support such formats and even reverse
engineer them where required.

<P>
<B>Q: Is it legal to use such proprietary/patented IP?</B>
<BR>
A: IP laws change wildly between jurisdictions. Further, even in places where
software IP is recognized, there is serious doubt about the legitimacy of such
legislation.

<P>
<B>Q: Bottom line: Should I be worried about legal issues if I use FFmpeg?</B>
<BR>
A: Are you a private user working with FFmpeg for your own personal purposes?
If so, there is remarkably little reason to be concered. Are you using FFmpeg 
in a commercial software product? Read on to the next question...

<P>
<B>Q: Since FFmpeg is licensed under the LGPL, is it perfectly all right to
incorporate the whole FFmpeg core into my own commercial product?</B>
<BR>
A: You might have a problem here. Sure the LGPL allows you to incorporate the
code. However, there have been cases where companies have
used FFmpeg in their projects, usually for such capabilities as superior
MPEG-4 decoding. These companies found out that once you start trying to
make money from certain technologies, the alleged owners of the technologies
will come after their dues. Most notably, MPEG-LA (licensing authority) is
vigilant and diligent about collecting for MPEG-related technologies.
