<h1>The end draws near...</h1>

<p>
<strong>
	Multimedia is a
	<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Mpegla05En">patent minefield</a>.
	All important techniques, formats and standards are covered by broad
	and trivial patents that harm progress and make independent
	implementations hard or impossible. Thus FFmpeg and the
	free software multimedia players, like
	<a href="http://mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a>,
	<a href="http://xinehq.de/">xine</a>,
	<a href="http://videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>,
	<a href="http://avifile.sf.net/">avifile</a>,
	<a href="http://gstreamer.net/">gstreamer</a>,
	for which FFmpeg provides the framework, are seriously
	threatened by software patents. Already companies are succeeding
	at driving multimedia libraries out of existence with
	<a href="http://videolan.org/libdca.html">legal threats</a>.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
	The Council of the European Union has adopted its so-called
	"Common	Position" on software patents,
	<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Cons050307En">violating democratic rules and procedures</a>
	to the sole benefit of big multinational (mostly non-European)
	corporations and Ireland and to the detriment of small and medium
	sized businesses (which comprise the majority of the European
	software industry) and free software.
</p>

<p>
	If the European Parliament fails to rally an absolute majority (367)
	of all members of the European Parliament - not just an absolute
	majority of the attending members - for substantial amendments in
	July, then the Council's directive will become law and the hunting
	season for US-style software patent enforcement in Europe will begin.
	Such a majority is hard to come by in a parliament with a low
	attendance level.
</p>

<p>
	But not all is lost yet as long as <strong>you</strong> decide it is
	time to make a difference and take action. This is our last opportunity
	to fend off software patents worldwide, there will be no second chance
	for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org">Signing petitions</a> will not
	suffice. Contact your local EU representatives and educate them why
	<a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/industry-at-risk.html">software patents are a bad idea in the first place</a>
	and why they <strong>must</strong> attend that parliament session to
	vote against them. Make it clear that they need to stop the
	<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/LtrFfiiCons050308En">machinations of the Council of the European Union</a>
	and reaffirm the power of the EU parliament, the only democratically
	elected EU institution.
